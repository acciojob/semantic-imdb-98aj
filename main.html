                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <li>n the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
                        are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
                        blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
                        to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
                        weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
                        pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
                        when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
                        able to do what</li>
